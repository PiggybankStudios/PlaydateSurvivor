# TODO List
	@ Anyone		
		[!] Infinite map
		[ ] Movement direction input bug
				* holding left still doesn't work sometimes
				* input gets stuck sometimes - don't know if only a simulator bug or not
		[ ] Playdate Itch.io pages and Discord Updates
				* Page for Survivors
				* Page for CDoku
				* Page for Floragram
				* updates to playdate discord with dev logs
		[ ] Show End-Of-Round Timer on screen (somewhere)
		[!] Talk about End-Of-Timer End State
				* vampire survivor reaper that kills player?
				* endless modes?
				* progression?
				* what's the most interesting thing to us?
		[ ] Character gun is too offset from bullet spawn point
				* might adjust spawn point of bullets
				* also need to make a better player sprite
	@ Taylor
		[ ] Add some guns
			[ ] Potion gun
				* Throwing a potion or vial
				* leaves behind an AoE
				* short life time so it doesn't travel far
			[ ] Arrow gun
				* Shoots arrow, pierces enemy, sticks in wall, does damage if someone is touching the arrow
			[!] Shield
				* Floats in front of the player slightly,
				* Rotating to block damage in a direction,
				* Knockback when enemy touches it
				* Knockback damage scaled by retaliation stat, if none, it does no damage
				* Does 1 damage at least so no soft-lock
			[ ] Laser Sword
				* Laser sword that sticks in front of you
				* Maybe we should do a sword swipe effect instead of laser sword
			[ ] Chaos Gun
				* Shoots out random bullets, or maybe squiggle bullets
				* Like worm wiggling back and forth
				* Random speed, damage, size, angle, etc. for each bullet
			[ ] Punch Gun
				* quick random hits at short range with high knockback
			[ ] Spear Gun
				* attack out quickly piercing in a thin straight line erratically
			[ ] Hammer gun - area smash with high knock back
		[ ] Add some monsters
			[!] Shooter
				* Gets to a particular distance from player and tries to maintain it while shooting you
			[ ] Splitter
				* Comes within a certain distance and then creates a copy
				* Copy is slightly different, it just flies directly at you
				* Kill him to stop him spawning infinite enemies
				* Copies don't drop anything
			[ ] Mother
				* Spawns a ton of tiny enemies
				* Fly for a bit in a random direction, then fly at the player, then random again
				* Kind of like a beehive
			[ ] Pooper
				* Roams randomly, not trying to hit the player
				* Attempts to be within a certain distance of the player
				* Leaves behind acid pools periodically, also when it dies
				* Acid pools do damage when you stand on them
			[ ] Rook/Statue
				* 2 states
				*  1: Move on a single axis only (x or y), for some distance
				*  2: When he stops, he turns into a statue, eyes disappear, and is immune to all damage
			[ ] Bubble
				* Tries to spiral towards player
				* First he's really slow
				* has rings around the outside
				* rings disappear as he takes damage
				* gets faster as rings disappear
				* smaller and smaller hit box as ring disappear
			[ ] Bomb
				* After it takes a certain amount of much damage, it lights on fire and attempts to explode
			[ ] Vampire
				* Doesn't move conventionally, teleports instead
				* Teleports within a range of the player
				* While near the player he sucks your life force, and regens his own health
				* If you move away from him, it will take him a bit to teleport to you again
			[?] On death of guy that runs away (looks like a plus sign) Maybe he could heal guys around him when he dies?
